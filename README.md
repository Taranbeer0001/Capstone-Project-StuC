# **Elearn: Web application for Learning** 

# OBJECTIVES
With its quick access to specialized knowledge and information, "StuC" marks a ground-breaking change in the field of education. It delivers Web-based courseware that uses graphical representation to give detailed data and analysis of users attending a particular course. Users will benefit from being held accountable for how many courses they have attempted in comparison to other users. Users will be able to receive counseling through StuC regarding their questions and course selection. Users will also find the history and present technology popularity after visiting the StuC website.

 # DESCRIPTION
The StuC website is an analysis tool that will swiftly assist any user in gathering information and the topic's crispness in a visually engaging manner. We intend to design an application that can handle all types of data and is suitable to manage any exception that will be thrown its way using our expertise in software programming and data pre-processing.
Making every effort to make the program as user-friendly and interactive as possible. Additionally, our application will have unit testing, which will test all the classes and methods that make up our function. Since our project is GUI-based, we will also investigate ways to highlight its key features and make it simple to use, even for brand-new users.
Our software will generate an image at the end of the program that will highlight each significant phrase. The number of times a word appears will determine its size.
